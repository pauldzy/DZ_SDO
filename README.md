#DZ_SDO
PL/SQL code for the manipulation and management of SDO_GEOMETRY.  This particular module has always been a kind of grab-bag of generic utilities and tools which I always assume could be repackaged into smaller modules.  As thus it has some disorganization I would like to correct eventually.

This library is provided for testing and feedback.  It may be installed and executed from any schema.  The deployment script creates three packages:

1. DZ\_SDO\_MAIN
2. DZ\_SDO\_TEST
3. DZ\_SDO\_UTIL

The test package is not needed for normal usage but always a good idea to inspect and keep around.

##Installation
Simply execute the deployment script into the schema of your choice.  Then execute the code using either the same or a different schema.  All procedures and functions are publically executable and utilize AUTHID CURRENT_USER for permissions handling.

##Collaboration
Forks and pulls are **most** welcome.  The deployment script and deployment documentation files in the repository root are generated by my [build system](https://github.com/pauldzy/Speculative_PLSQL_CI) which obviously you do not have.  You can just ignore those files and when I merge your pull my system will autogenerate updated files for GitHub.
